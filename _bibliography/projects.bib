  abstract = {"I give an illustration of a simple problem in which a Bayesian researcher can choose
between random assignment of a treatment or delegating assignment to an informed—but
motivated—agent. In effect she compares between learning from an RCT or from an observational study. She evaluates designs according to an expected squared error criterion (ESE).
I show that for a small problem (n “ 2) if she starts with a prior expectation of no treatment
effect but believes that the agent is an advocate of treatment with probability q (and otherwise
an opponent) then for all values of q she does at least as well delegating assignment as she
does from an RCT and she does strictly better as long as $q \neq 0.5$. For other priors on treatment
effects, randomization can dominate delegation or be dominated by it. As n grows the expected errors from an RCT design fall but errors from delegated assignment do not. Although
there is always some prior such that a delegated procedure beats randomized assignment, the
converse is not true. For a given prior there may be no delegated procedure that trumps an
RCT. With uniform priors for example the RCT dominates delegated assignment for all beliefs
on agent motivations when n $\geq$ 4.
